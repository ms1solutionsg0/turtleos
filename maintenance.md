# Maintenance
## Schedule
This exhibit is relatively static and not network connected.
Maintenance can be done every 6 months - year.

## Actions
- Check for new versions of turtleos from TurtleRover

### Code / Application
- No need to check for updates on these items. This is a "finished" exhibit.

### Feature requests and New Work
- This should be avoided as it's a low priority exhibit
